* TODO  Create setter for jnf/override-org-roam-template

Earlier <2022-01-22 Sat> I added the ~jnf/override-org-roam-template~ variable.
Now I need a way to set and unset that.  Iâ€™m imaginging the =$= key with a
completing read.  When the value is ~:all~ set ~jnf/override-org-roam-template~
to ~nil~.

The reason for this is that I have subjects and templates.  A subject has many templates.  Each template applies one or more tags.
