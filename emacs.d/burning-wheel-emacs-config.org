The functions of this file build on functions from [[file:configuration.org][Configuration]].

Being a programmer and someone who plays table top role-playing games (TTRPG),
I’ve often used the TTRPG rules-set or systems to explore programming languages
and processes.  After all, I understand the TTRPG rules well enough (or the
algorithm’s description) that I can spend time thinking through my approach in
a programming language.

* Quick Help Functions

Most role-playing games I play may require a bit of consultation. The following
“quick help” methods are tables that I commonly reference when playing Burning
Wheel Gold.

** Physical Trauma Gray Scale (PTGS)

When running Burning Wheel Gold, on occassion I need to establish the PTGS for
a creature or person.

Yes, I could’ve written out ~(0 "B1" "B2" "B3" "B4" "B5" "B6" "B7" "B8" "B9"
"B10" "B11" "B12" "B13" "B14" "B15" "B16" "G1" "G2" "G3" "G4" "G5" "G6" "G7"
"G8" "G9" "G10" "G11" "G12" "G13" "G14" "G15" "G16" "W1" "W2" "W3" "W4" "W5"
"W6" "W7" "W8" "W9" "W10" "W11" "W12" "W13" "W14" "W15" "W16")~ faster than the
following constant, but I wanted to learn a bit of emacs-lisp, so I chose to
write the following.[fn:1]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defconst jf/bwg-mortal-wounds-scale
    (let* ((shades '("B" "G" "W"))
	   (rank '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16))
	   (scale (-flatten
		   (-map (lambda (s)
			   (-map (lambda (r)
				   (format "%s%s" s r))
				 rank))
			 shades))))
      ;; I want B1 to have an index of 1.  Hence pre-pending the 0 to the list.
      (add-to-list 'scale 0)
      scale)
    "The BWG Physical Tolerance Grayscale (from B1 to W16).")

Next up is a function for calculating a Black or Gray PTGS.  This is not clean nor
elegant, but it works.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun jf/bwg-qh-ptgs (forte power &optional round-up)
    "Calculate Burning Wheel PTGS.

  This requires FORTE, POWER, and ROUND-UP.

  Note, this assumes Black or Grey shade only."
    (interactive "sForte: \nsPower: \nP")
    ;; Note the / function uses integer floor division.
    (let* ((forte-index (-elem-index (upcase forte) jf/bwg-mortal-wounds-scale))
	   (power-index (-elem-index (upcase power) jf/bwg-mortal-wounds-scale)))
      (unless forte-index (throw 'invalid-entry (format "Invalid Forte %s" forte)))
      (unless power-index (throw 'invalid-entry (format "Invalid Power %s" power)))
      (let ((scale (cond ((and (< forte-index 14) (< power-index 14))
			  (jf/bwg-qh-ptgs--shade-black forte-index

On page 98 of “Burning Wheel Gold Revised”, we have instructions for
calculating PTGS for most characters.  Page 546 overlays those instructions
with additional instructions for calculating Gray-shaded attributes.

    (let* ((mw-rnd (if round-up 1 0))

* Menu

The following menu is for quick help while playing Burning Wheel games.  I
previously defined the suffixes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (transient-define-prefix jf/menu--bwg ()
    "Define the BWG help prefix."

     ("e" jf/bwg-qh-expertise-exponent)
     ("p" "PTGS" jf/bwg-qh-ptgs)
     ("s" jf/bwg-qh-steel-test-adjustments)
     ("w" jf/bwg-qh-wises)
     ])

* Footnotes

[fn:1] I copyied that text string from the introspected variable.  Because if I
wasn't going to write it the first time, I sure wasn't going to do it if I had
already stored that value in a constant.
