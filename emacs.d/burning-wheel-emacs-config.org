* Quick Help Functions

Most role-playing games I play may require a bit of consultation. The following
“quick help” methods are tables that I commonly reference when playing Burning
Wheel Gold.

** Physical Trauma Gray Scale (PTGS)

When running Burning Wheel Gold, on occassion I need to establish the PTGS for
a creature or person.  This is a quick help function for that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun jf/bwg-qh-ptgs (forte power &optional round-up)
    "Calculate Burning Wheel PTGS.

  This requires FORTE, POWER, and ROUND-UP.

  Note, this assumes Black shade only."
    (interactive "nForte: \nnPower: \nP")
    ;; Note the / function uses integer floor division.
    (let* ((mw-rnd (if round-up 1 0))
	   (mo (+ 6 (/ (+ forte power mw-rnd) 2)))
	   (step (+ (/ (+ 1 forte) 2)))
	   (su (+ 1 (/ forte 2)))
	   (li (+ su step))
	   (mi (+ li step))
	   (se (+ mi step))
	   (tr (+ se step))
	   (tr (if (< tr mo) tr (- mo 1)))
	   (se (if (< se tr) se (- tr 1)))
	   (mi (if (< mi se) mi (- se 1)))
	   (li (if (< li mi) li (- mi 1)))
	   (text (format
		  (concat "PTGS: Su %s, Li %s, Mi %s, Se %s, Tr %s, Mo %s"
			  "\nForte: %s, Power: %s, Round Up: %s")
		  su li mi se tr mo
		  forte power (if round-up "yes" "no"))))
      (kill-new text)
      (message text)))

* Menu

The following menu is for quick help while playing Burning Wheel games.  I
previously defined the suffixes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-s-b") 'jf/menu--bwg)
  (transient-define-prefix jf/menu--bwg ()
    "Define the BWG help prefix."
    ["Burning Wheel"
     ("c" jf/bwg-qh-circles-obstacles)
     ("d" jf/bwg-qh-absolute-difficulty)
     ("e" jf/bwg-qh-expertise-exponent)
     ("p" "PTGS" jf/bwg-ptgs)
     ("s" jf/bwg-qh-steel-test-adjustments)
     ("w" jf/bwg-qh-wises)
     ])
