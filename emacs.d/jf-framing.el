;;; Commentary:

;;
;; This personal package provides logic for both a focus mode and presentation
;; mode.  There are several assumptions about packages, but I guard those
;; assumptions with `fboundp'.
;;
;; To enter focus mode: "M-x logos-focus-mode"
;; To enter presentation mode: "M-x jf/minor-mode/presenter"

;;; Code:

(provide 'jf-framing)
