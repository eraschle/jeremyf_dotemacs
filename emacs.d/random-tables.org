Earlier, I stumbled upon ~decide-mode~, a package for random decision making.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package decide
    :straight (decide :host github :type git :repo "jeremyf/decide-mode"))
#+end_src

It has some of what I want, but I keep thinking to [[https://github.com/jeremyf/gm-notepad][gm-notepad]], a command-line
tool that I wrote in [[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/][Ruby]].

My ideal scenario is to use [[id:4A9A1E08-7CD1-4089-B2C7-F70FB900B38F]["Stars without Number" by Kevin Crawford]] and
[[id:F791CFFC-1DA6-4D2D-96A7-A32653CF5E03]["Worlds without Number" by Kevin Crawford]] nested tables.  The Stars without
Number tables are extracted on the http://www.random-generator.com site, along
with many other random tables.

The ~decide-mode~ package handles some of this nesting.
