Welcome to the graveyard; I'm not ready to fully say good-bye, but these are not part of my required code.

** My Collection of Org Roam interactions

The =node-id= below is an [[denote:20221009T115044][Org-Roam]] node, something Iâ€™ve moved away from in favor of Denote.  My reason for keeping this is a reminder of the =seq-mapcat= function.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun jf/blockquote-hugo (node-id)
  "Export the blockquote for the given NODE-ID"
  (let ((data (jf/org-mode-extract-body-and-properties node-id)))
    (concat
     "\n{{{< blockquote " (jf/hugo-blockquote-attributes-for (plist-get data :properties)) ">}}}\n"
     (format "%s" (plist-get data :body))
     "\n{{{< /blockquote >}}}\n")))

(defun jf/hugo-blockquote-attributes-for (properties)
  "Map the PROPERTIES to attributes."
  (seq-mapcat (lambda (element)
    (let ((key (car element))
          (text (cadr element)))
      (pcase key
        ("ID" (format "orgId=\"%s\" " text))
        ("TITLE" (format "cite=\"%s\" " text))
        ("CITE_URL" (format "citeUrl=\"%s\" " text))
        ("AUTHOR" (format "pre=\"%s\" " text))
        ("CITE_POST" (format "post=\"%s\" " text))
        (_ ""))))
