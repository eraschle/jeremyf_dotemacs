#+title: README for Dotemacs

This is my Emacs configuration repository.  It pairs with my [[https://github.com/jeremyf/dotzshrc/][dotzshrc repository]].  The [[https://github.com/jeremyf/dotzshrc/blob/main/install.rb][install.rb]] script of the dotzshrc repository uses this repository.  For implementation reasons, the =emacs.d= directory contains the init files that I link into my =$HOME/.emacs.d= directory.

For those curious, I wrote [[https://takeonrules.com/2020/10/18/why-i-chose-emacs-as-my-new-text-editor/][Why I Chose Emacs as My New Text Editor // Take on Rules]].

* The Structure

Below is the top-level directory:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  > tree -L 1
  .
  ├── README.org
  ├── deprecated-packages
  ├── emacs.d
  ├── lib
  └── snippets

  4 directories, 1 file
#+END_EXAMPLE

The files and directories:

- README.org :: This file.
- emacs.d :: A directory that contains files symlinked into =$HOME/.emacs.d=
  directory.
- deprecated-packages :: A directory of elisp-files.  I have since moved
  towards a literate configuration style.
- snippets :: A directory of [[https://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/][yasnippets]] I’ve created.

* The emacs.d Directory

There are two “primary” files to consider in ~./emacs.d~:

- [[file:emacs.d/configuration.org][configuration.org]] :: This file is where I write my Emacs configuration with a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][Literate programming]] mindset. (/Note:/ This is a conversion from my past structure, but as I make new functions, I try to approach solutions with a Literate Programming mindset.)
- [[file:emacs.d/init.el][init.el]] :: The file evaluated when Emacs launches.  Using [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][Org Babel]], it evaluates the configuration.org file.

/At some point, I move the configuration file up to the repository README level; that would mean treating the configuration as my almost entire discourse on how I Emacs./

* Digging Further into emacs.d

I’m starting to disassemble the large singular configuration file.  At present the org files I have are as follows:

- configuration.org :: I wrote about that above.
- [[file:emacs.d/burning-wheel-emacs-config.org][burning-wheel-emacs-config.org]] :: This contains specific utilities that I use when playing Burning Wheel.  It’s a prototype for how I might think about other games; looking at you “Stars without Number” and “Worlds without Number.”
- [[file:emacs.d/forem-config.org][forem-config.org]] :: These are functions that help me do my day job.
- [[file:emacs.d/random-tables.org][random-tables.org]] :: Some random tables mixed with further thoughts about random tables.
