#+title: README for Dotemacs

This is my Emacs repository.  It pairs with my [[https://github.com/jeremyf/dotzshrc/][dotzshrc repository]].  The [[https://github.com/jeremyf/dotzshrc/blob/main/install.rb][install.rb]] script of the dotzshrc repository uses this repository.  For implementation reasons, the ~emacs.d~ the init files that I link into my ~\~/.emacs.d~ directory.  The ~jnf-packages~ are my “packages” that I’ve separated out for organizational purposes.
